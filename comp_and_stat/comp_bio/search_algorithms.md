## Searching along a path

### Eulerian Path

Graph `G` with `V` vertices and `E` edges. A Eulerian path starts at one vertex
and travels through every edge exactly once. Called a `Eulerian Cycle` if the
path starts and ends at the same vertex.

### Hamiltonian Path

Same notation as above except every *vertex* is visited exactly once.

# Specific Aims Workshop

References to:

**The Grant Application Writer's Workbook**

_Stephen W. Russell and David C. Morrison_

**_Book is good guidance but not exactly completely applicable to quals proposal_**

## Full Proposal - 7 pages

* Specific Aims
  * 2 or 3
* Significance and Innovation (1 - 1.5 Pages)
  * Significance - why is this project worth doing?
  * Innovation - why is your way different than existing approaches?
  * Background
  * Capture attention of reader
* Research Strategy
  * Develop aims (1-2 pages per aim)
* Develop consistent outline to describe next steps over time (suggested to be 2 months)
* Encourage discussion with advisor

## What to expect at exam time

* Not disrupted 10 to 15 minutes
* Prepare 20 to 25 minute presentation
* Run presentation by Maya ~1 week before

## Specific Aims

### Introductory Paragraph

* Introduce **most relevant** current knowledge
  * Very difficult
  * Strike a balance between specific to proposal and cover background
* What is the current knowledge gap?
  * Specific thing of what you're going to do in the statement of need sentence
  * Next is to tie into what we need to specifically do to fill

### What, Why, Who Paragraph

* Identify both long term and near term objective
  * For next 10 to 15 years
     * Exmample - develop target drug for childhood leukemia
  * Purpose is to show long term vision
  * Not _that_ important for our proposal
  * Different for the terms of the project
* Hypothesis driven
  * NIH now saying that you don't need one?
  * Add only a "real" hypothesis - not actually that important for method development
    * Needs to be specific
    * Not viewed as a negative?
  * Or, state Null hypothesis?
* Rationale - why did you come up with this hypothesis?
  * When delineating aims will get opportunity to expand rationale
  * This section should be general to the total outlook of grant

### Specific Aims

* State what you want to do
  * Not necessarily specifically mention the specific assay, protocol, or data
* State working hypothesis with a general idea of how you're going to approach each aim
  * Assays, data, methods, etc.
* Can address some level of aim dependence in the pitfalls/alternative approaches section
* Some PIs add a figure

### Payoff Paragraph

* What will be the short term and long term impact if proposal is successful
* For when a reviewer asks "so what?"
* What is the general impact of proposal

## Writing Process

* Write down key words in skeleton
  * Can polish it later on
* Then expand key words into outline
* Then expand outline into paragraphs

## Going through my aims

_Comments and Suggestions_

* Not necessarily need to introduce GRN?
  * Got lost because unclear how they relate to Goals, Hypothesis, and Rationale
  * Need a clear balance
* Everyone knows gene expression is important for disease, maybe don't need to discuss that
* Go deeper than just stratefying?
  * What is the pattern you're looking for?
    * Beyond just clustering
    * Gets more specific and makes it more exciting (disease stratification)
* Try to make it more specific
  * Dynamics of expression patterns?
  * E.g. state what is actually "supervised" (and what algorithm)
* Specifically point out what the limitations are instead of just listing them
* First sentence is general knowledge = boring
  * More specific - what exactly (i.e. stratefication makes it difficult)
    * Cell type contamination
* Details about how the method connects into project
  * More details about method in general!
* Aim 1 description needs to be development of method
  * Where else has method be used?
  * What would the impact be of this method?
  * "Benchmark to existing methods"
* Aim 2 and 3 are existing aims
* Hypothesis in Aim
  * What would you do to analyze the data?
    * Example: Critical Dataset?
* "precision medicine" does not add much for particular proposal
  * Maybe expand upon in other sections

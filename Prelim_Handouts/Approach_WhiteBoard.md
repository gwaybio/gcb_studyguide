## Approach
  * Aim
    * Introduction (1 or 2 sentences per bullet point)
      * Motivation/current status quo
      * What is the Gap?
      * Objective/Rational
      * Working Hypothesis
    * Preliminary Data
      * Your own/ lab's work
      * The lab's work
    * Research Design (Do this n times, where n is each bullet point/sub-aim of a single aim)
       * Sub Aim/ Piece #: Explicity state sub aim (Balance between how and why)
         * Experimental Strategy/Logic (Elaborate on bullet points in Aims)
           * Can use Cartoon/Flow Chart
         * Stats and Methods (NOT MATERIALS AND METHODS)
           * Positive and Negative Controls
           * Power Analysis
           * How to evaluate your SUCCESS!
    * Expected Results and Intepretations
      * Alternative Approaches (This could also under Research Design)
            * Potential Pitfalls
      * what does it mean if you obtain the predicted outcome or not-you must consider both options? 
         * If your hypothesis is right, are you done?
         * If your hypothesis is wrong, does it show that you are missing something?
      * what can the field do after your aim is complete that it cant now
      * Reproducibility
        * Where will your code be available?
        * Note: This can also go under Research Design.
 * Other Comments:
   * Figures SHOULD BE BOLDED
   * Need figures for prelim data
   * Table of datasets
   * Reproducibity plan
 * Overall Outline
   * Title
   * Abstract
   * Specific Aims
   * Significance
   * Innovation
   * Approach
   * Conclusion/ Future Directions
